# Elemental Weapons System - Unity Project

## Overview
The **Elemental Weapons System** is a Unity-based prototype developed as part of an interview task. It demonstrates how to integrate various elemental properties into a weapon system, allowing for dynamic and interactive combat scenarios.

## Features
- **Weapon Switching**: Seamlessly switch between Fire, Ice, and Lightning modes.
- **Elemental Effects**: Each element triggers unique visual and gameplay mechanics:
- **Real-Time Effects**: Visual graph and shader graph for immersive visual feedback.

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
4. Press **Play** in the Unity Editor to start testing the system.

OR

1. Download APK from releases
2. Install and Play

## Usage
- **UI**:
  - Press UI buttons with icons to switch between Fire, Ice, and Lightning modes respectively.
  - Attack with "Attack button".

## Customization
- The weapon behaviors are modular and can be extended easily:
  - Create new weapon with already included weapon type or easily add new inheriting weapon base
  - Attach unique effects to each element by modifying the associated script.
- Visual effects can be updated through the Unity Inspector under the `VFX` folder.

## Conclusion
This project highlights my ability to design modular, visually engaging systems while tackling common development challenges. It is a foundation for any game featuring dynamic weapon systems. Potential future improvements include more complex elemental interactions and enhanced AI reactions.
